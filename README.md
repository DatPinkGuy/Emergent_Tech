This is one of the projects that I got to develop during my stay at University as BSc.</br>
The project's main idea is to give user a space which they could use as a reference for real life and model that virtual environment with any furniture or decorations available at the time.</br></br>
You can see the project in action at the link below:</br>

Systems created for this project allow for:</br>
1. Automatic sorting of all available furniture into different categories based on room type selected for furniture (used for in-game menu)</br>

2. Furniture and decorations can only be placed on areas specified by user</br>

3. Furniture and decor can be moved, rotated, placed and removed from the scene</br>
