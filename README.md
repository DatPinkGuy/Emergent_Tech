This is one of the projects that I got to develop during my stay at University as BSc.</br>
The project's main idea is to give user a space which they could use as a reference for real life and model that virtual environment with any furniture or decorations available at the time.</br>
Systems created for this project allow for:</br>
1. Automatic sorting of all available furniture into different categories based on room type selected for furniture (used for in-game menu)
2. Furniture and decorations can only be placed on areas specified by user
3. Furniture and decor can be moved, rotated, placed and removed from the scene
4. Line renderer only appears when user can interact with something
